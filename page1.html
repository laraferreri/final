            <div class= "text3"> Social media helped me become more in-tuned with my creative genes and grow as an artist. I am able to be creative when trying to come up with content for my profiles.  These platforms give me a chance to express my creative thoughts outside of school.

      </div>

      <div class="text2"> That being said, social media has become a positive outlet for my inner battles and an escape of reality. I am able to release the stresses and anxieties of my everyday life on these platforms. There are so many new intrests that I have sparked from looking at other peoples pages. Social media is a great way to find new hobbies or intrests to pick up.

  <div class="text4"> Social media has connected me with so many people from all across the world. Through the internet, we can learn about peoples lifestyle and customs that live all the way across the country. Not only that, but we are able to stay in contact with long distance friends and family.</div>

<div class="text5"> Overall, social media has developed into a platform for people to express whatever they chose. It gives people a chance to create and think creativly.  Whether its from taking pictures for your instagram, or tweeting a new idea that came to mind, social media is a place for people to say, do, and look however they want.  It is a way for peole to stay connected with eachother and get disconnected from the world around you.  </div>


<div class="text6"> Social media has provided me with different ways to show my art to a large platform of people. Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter are all great places to share your art or even an idea.  </div>
